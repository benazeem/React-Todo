# React Todo App

Welcome to the React Todo App! This project is a simple yet powerful task management application built with React, Redux, and TypeScript. It showcases various modern web development practices, including state management, custom hooks, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Easily add new tasks to your todo list with a keyboard-friendly input.
- **Mark as Complete**: Toggle the completion status of each todo item.
- **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Filter Todos**: View all, active, or completed todos with an intuitive filter system.
- **Drag and Drop**: Reorder your todos using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes.
- **Persistent State**: Save and load your todos from localStorage, ensuring your tasks are always available.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: The official, recommended way to write Redux logic.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
